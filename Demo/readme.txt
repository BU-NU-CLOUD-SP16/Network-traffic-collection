This folder contains a version for streaming, another for reading traffic from pcap files, and a version of the detection script that allows for cutting connections to VM's with malicious traffic (only to be used with System_Stream in the case that you are somehow able to generate malicious traffic from a VM for testing, we were not allowed to within the scope of this project in the MOC).
